This is YOUR Readme file.  We will manually review your file looking for:

(1) A summary description of your project design.  If you wish to use
    grapics, please simply use a URL to point to a JPG or PNG file that
    we can review.

(2) Any additional observations that you have about what you've done. What
    created problems for you?  What tests would you have added to the test
    suite?  If you were going to do this project again, how would you improve it?
